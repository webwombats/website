## How to develop?

This project uses .editorconfig file, Eslint and Prettier, it's recommended that configure your editor/IDE to track and
display linting errors as you go.

Also linters run before commit, so if there's an error preventing commit -- check the message and fix it before putting
code to repository.

You can run linters manually with `yarn lint`.
